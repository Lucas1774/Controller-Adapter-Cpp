# Usage

Just double-click the .bat file. Use Windows' Game Controllers to map button ID to button in the `config.json` file.  
In some controllers, the pad inputs are handled differently, and don't need id mapping. In others, they are regular buttons. The program will correctly handle either. Back triggers are similar in this aspect, and can be either buttons or analog axis.
It is possible to configure whether the program is activated on boot or not, as well as it is to map a button to toggle activation. When deactivated, it will just listen to an activation input.
